# Profile
profile: |
  Hi, my name is Constantine Tourtsakis. I'm currently studying IT at the
  department of the Ionian University which is why this page is quite empty.
  I'm interested in coding, video game modding and software in general. 

# Experience
experience:
  - role: Student 
    time: 2019-present
    company: Ionian University
    details: |
      I have yet to get a degree so all of my experience comes from University
      assignments all of which had to do with the following technologies/programming
      languages.
    technologies_used: | 
      C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Git, Oracle SQL Developer

projects:
  - title: RAGE Mod Manager
    link: https://github.com/KonstantinosTourtsakis/RAGE-Mod-Manager
    details: |
      RAGE Mod Manager is a simple console Python application which can be used
      various games developed from Rockstar Games. This is a tool that makes it
      easy uninstalling/reinstalling mods to the supported games. Why is it useful?
      Modding games in Online modes is prohibited, therefore users need to uninstall
      any previously installed singleplayer mods to avoid getting banned from the 
      Online mode.

 - title: ProgrammaP2019
   link: https://github.com/KonstantinosTourtsakis/ProgrammaP2019
   details: |
      ProgrammaP2019 is a static website hosted on GitHub. This website was used
      to make it easier attending to the online lectures on the Ionian University
      during lockdowns.
      It pretty much included a table of the semester's schedule where the
      user could find a link to the corresponding lecture. This made it easier and
      faster joining these online lectures.
